# Vieguettes

This is a food web app called Vieguettes which is soley based on baguettes. It allows customers to choose what baguettes they would like to order, having the ability to increase or decrease the quantity for that item. There is also the option to delete the item off the basket.
Users would need to register in order to place an order.
Once they have registered, they would need to confirm their order and make a payment.
Once this has been completed, the user will be taken to a confirmation page to indicate that they have placed an order.

Here's the [live demo](https://vieguettes.netlify.app/) of the app
